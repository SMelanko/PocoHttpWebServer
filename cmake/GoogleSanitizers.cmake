# Dynamic testing tools for C/C++:
# - AddressSanitizer (ASan) is a fast memory error detector. It finds use-after-free
#   and {heap,stack,global}-buffer overflow bugs in C/C++ programs.
# - MemorySanitizer (MSan) is a fast LLVM-based tool that detects the use of uninitialized memory.
# - ThreadSanitizer (TSan) is a fast data race detector for C/C++ programs.
# These tools are based on compiler instrumentation (LLVM and GCC), which makes them very fast,
# for example ASan incurs just 2x slowdown.
